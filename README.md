# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

A simple app which says 'Â¡Hola, mundo!', translation of the useful sentence 'Hello World!' usually, print at first when starting with a new programming adventure in computer science

I deploy it on heroku at [rails-tutorial-hallo-app](https://rails-tutorial-hallo-app.herokuapp.com/)
